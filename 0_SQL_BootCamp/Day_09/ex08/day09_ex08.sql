-- Please write a SQL or pl/pgsql function fnc_fibonacci (itâ€™s up to you) that has an input parameter
-- pstop with type integer (by default is 10) and the function output is a table with all
-- Fibonacci numbers less than pstop.

-- To check yourself and call a function, you can make a statements like below.
select * from fnc_fibonacci(100);
