-- Letâ€™s make a simple aggregation, please write a SQL statement that returns person identifiers
-- and corresponding number of visits in any pizzerias and sorting by count of visits in descending mode
-- and sorting in person_id in ascending mode. Please take a look at the sample of data below.

SELECT person_id, count(*) as count_of_visits
FROM person_visits
GROUP BY person_id
ORDER BY count_of_visits DESC, person_id ASC;
